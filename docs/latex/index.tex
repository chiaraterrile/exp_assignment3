This project is based on the navigation of a wheeled robot (with an R\+GB camera and a laser) in an enviroment with walls and colored balls that correspond to a precise location (e.\+g. living room, kitchen ecc..). The robot is able to switch in different states, according to what it sees, and according to the user commands.

For more informations about the working principles you can have a look to the readme file.

Here you can find all the file used (R\+OS nodes) and their functions and classes.
